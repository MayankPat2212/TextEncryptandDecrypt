A simple Python Script that implements an encryption and decryption script to securely manage text-based information.
The tool uses common cryptographic algorithms (e.g.,AES, Caesar Cipher) to encrypt sensitive information and thus maintain confidentiality and integrity during communications.
User can enter plaintext messages,which are securely encrypted with a user-provided key and then decrypted back to the original message using the same key
